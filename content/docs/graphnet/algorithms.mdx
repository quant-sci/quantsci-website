# Graph Traversal

One of graph algorithms' main applications is finding the shortest path given two nodes u and v. This section describes some algorithms that can be used to achieve this goal. The most famous and with several applications are depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Djikstra. For extension, another two approaches: Bellman-Ford and A*.
